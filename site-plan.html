    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <h4>Heading Font: IM Fell French Canon SC</h4>
    <p>I love how the font looks and how they need to have differnet fonts with every differnet line because I need to
      have my webiste look cool and like how I like my own website going for me. </p>
    <h4>Paragraph Font: Lato, Helvetica, sans-serif</h4>
    <p>Then, the paragraph font that I have chosen for this is tha I want the people to understand and know what I am
      saying for this. </p>
    <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
    <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our
      shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe alternative
      for your family.</p>
    <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
    <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
      traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and freshing up
      in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
